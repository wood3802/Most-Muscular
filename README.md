First Person Body Building Dungeon Crawler

This project began as a tabletop roleplaying game a friend and I were working on. I thought it might be fun to make a
version of the game in the vein of the old Might and Magic games I played as a little kid. The game isn't close to being done
but I'm hoping to have a little prototype with the core gameplay (monsters that try and fight you; combat passed on body building
poses in a sort of rock-paper-scisscors type match up) completed. This is easily the largest Unity project I've worked on.
